# Federal_Crimes_and_Rental_Homes

An analysis of Federal crimes and rental home cost in the us 

### SUMMARY: This project will seek to see if there is a higher rate of federal crime in certain cities or states and from there will seek to determine if the areas with higher crime have lower median rental house costs.

### MOTIVATION: As a young family or someone just out of college renting a house is becoming a more viable and afforadable option. Therefore knowing what areas to move or rent a house from would be huge. 

### DATA QUESTIONS: Based on 6 criteria relating crime to renting a hosue we will look at do higher rates of crime mean lower rental costs. Looking at the data collected we will also look into crimes per capita across the U.S. as well as median rental costs. 

### ISSUES AND CHALLENGES: This project was heavily centered around data cleaning and normalization in excel, python and tableau. The crime files were in an outdated excel format so they needed to be updated to the new formating to be brought into python. After that was accomplished then the data needed cleaning and organization into dataframes to perform key aggregations.

This cleaning process - which can be found in the attached Jupyter notebook files for Python 3 -  allowed a smooth transition into tableau where the main analysis can start and is pretty straight forward.
